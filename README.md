<h1 align="center">Horse-Race-Prediction</h1>

## 1. Introduction

This project aims to predict horse racing outcomes using machine learning techniques. The dataset includes detailed information on horse races and individual horses from 1990 to 2020. Given the complexity and inherent unpredictability of horse racing, this project seeks to explore various machine learning models and feature engineering techniques to improve prediction accuracy.

## 2. Dataset Description

The dataset consists of two main types of files: races and horses, each available for every year from 1990 to 2020. Additionally, a forward.csv file contains information collected before the race starts.

The Contains information collected prior to race starts, including average odds from Oddschecker.com, and current RPR and TR values.
